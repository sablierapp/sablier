# Docker

The Docker provider communicates with the `docker.sock` socket to start and stop containers on demand.

## Use the Docker provider

In order to use the docker provider you can configure the [provider.name](../configuration) property.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **File (YAML)**

```yaml
provider:
  name: docker
```

#### **CLI**

```bash
sablier start --provider.name=docker
```

#### **Environment Variable**

```bash
PROVIDER_NAME=docker
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

!> **Ensure that Sablier has access to the docker socket!**

```yaml
services:
  sablier:
    image: sablierapp/sablier:1.9.0
    command:
      - start
      - --provider.name=docker
    volumes:
      - '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock'
```

## Register containers

For Sablier to work, it needs to know which docker container to start and stop.

You have to register your containers by opting-in with labels.

```yaml
services:
  whoami:
    image: acouvreur/whoami:v1.10.2
    labels:
      - sablier.enable=true
      - sablier.group=mygroup
```

## How does Sablier knows when a container is ready?

If the container defines a Healthcheck, then it will check for healthiness before stating the `ready` status.

If the containers do not define a Healthcheck, then as soon as the container has the status `started`

## Pause and unpause containers

Instead of fully stopping the containers and starting them again you can also just pause and unpause them. This will only prevent cpu load, the memory will remain loaded.

For this, just add a `sablier.pauseOnly=true` label:

```yaml
services:
  whoami:
    image: acouvreur/whoami:v1.10.2
    labels:
      - sablier.enable=true
      - sablier.pauseOnly=true
```

Note, that stopped containers will still be started, even when `pauseOnly` is set.
